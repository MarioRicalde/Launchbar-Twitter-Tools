## What is this

It’s a set of tools for LaunchBar that will help you with your exciting Twitter “life”:

1. Tweet: Tweet anything you want. It works with growl notifications and checks for tweet length and shorten links for you.
2. Tweetsong: Tweet the song you're listening to on your iTunes with a comment! You can even add a autolink which will fetch the first youtube video that matches the song tilte!
3. Open Twitter user: Open in your default web browser the profile page for the twitter username supplied.

## Instructions

Just copy the contents of this file to your `~/Library/Application Support/Launchbar/Actions/` directory. Open them with AppleScript Editor and modify the username and password.

To make these scripts compatible with OAuth we use [SuperTweet](http://www.supertweet.net/), which works as an API for it to safely work with cURL.
